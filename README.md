# Python-Analysis
Python and Plotly Dash used to analyze and graph Covid 19 data

I am a hobbyist learning Python and Dash.  With any tool one needs to have a project on which to work.
When Covid19 reared it's head and we were staying home, I decided to spend some time looking at the publically
availabe data and analyze it using Python.

Along the way, I had to refresh myself on Pycharm and learn more about Plotly and and Plotly Dash.  Also, a great tool
for prototyping is Jupyter lab and Plotly Chart Editor.  

I have been working locally or using Google's Colab for prottyping.  Now that I have several analyses, I want to share those with family and colleague.  Yet again, I must learn 
a new platform of Heroku and reacquaint myself with Git and GitHub.
